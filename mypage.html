		<h3>Shattering Glass</h3>
		<p class="first">Who is most responsible for what happened to Simon? Teens and adults should read this extraordinary book Shattering Glass written by Gail Giles. This book has a lot of amazing characters with different personality traits. I think Rob, Young and Simon himself is responsible for what happened to Simon.
		I think Rob is most responsible for what happened to Simon. He's responsible because he was the one who wanted to change him in the beginning and he was the leader. For example Rob told Coop that “it’s better to make Glass popular than make fun of him” (Giles pgs11-14)   and they went to talk to him at lunch time. Also Simon told Rob’s friend about his past when his father molested him and that was really personal stuff to Rob so it made him really angry, and that’s why he hit him with the bat. That is why I think rob is most responsible for what happened to Simon.
		I also think Young is responsible. I think he's responsible because Young’s anger towards Simon because Rob told him to give his dream girl to Simon so he could become poplular.  Also Young never did like Simon to begin with. This is why I think this character is responsible for what happened.
		Simon himself I think is responsible for what happened. I think this because if greed and popularity didn’t overcome him his way of thinking, his death wouldn’t have happened so he would still be alive, for example when he started telling everyone about Rob’s past with the incident that happened with him and his father, Simon told Rob “man accused by wife of molesting their son. She discovered it, but it had gone since the kid was eleven” (Giles pg 212) he could of just kept it to himself instead of telling people about it. And if at the beginning he would’ve just told Rob no at the beginning he would still be alive. So that is why Simon is responsible for what his death.
		This is why Rob, Young and Simon are all responsible for what happened. They all were angry and they all wanted to be the most popular student in school so they started betraying each other’s trust.  Would you ever kill your friend if they were to reveal your biggest secret?</p>
		<p>In Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games, the Hunger Games reality TV series that occurs once every year. One boy and one girl tribute is chosen from each district to participate in the Annual Hunger Games, where tributes are placed in an artificial environment, and fight to the death . Based on their attitude inside the games or inside the interviews, sponsor have the opportunity to support their favourite tributes by sending them gifts of food and other resources in the games. If the Capitol decided to issue an award for the greatest tribute who ever won The Hunger Games, Katniss would clearly be the winner and deserves this award. Katniss deserves this award because of her excellent survival skills, her emotional appeal to the audience, and because she is a force to be reckoned with throughout the games
		Katniss’s survival skills helps her a lot in the games, for example before the Games begin Katniss scored an 11 in training impressing the game makers and the viewers. Once inside the games and she gets away from the cornucopia she runs for a day searching for resources, but while doing that she gets burned from fire and has to run from the careers and is able to climb a tree that no one else was able to. Also, on page 190 she drops a tracker jacker nest on the careers while they are sleeping and receives multiple stings cutting the branch. After she recovers, Katniss forms an alliance with Rue and decides to make a plan to go on the offensive to weaken the Careers. Katniss says “Today we take out the Careers’ food”(210).
		Katniss is very protective/fight for the ones she loves. We first see this emotional side of  Katniss when her sister is picked as tribute at the reaping, “I volunteer!” I gasp. “I volunteer as tribute!”(22), Katniss volunteers as tribute to take her sisters place as tribute to take part in the Games. 
		In the book Katniss is very stubborn and determined. For example, after Peeta told Katniss not to go the feast, she gives him sleep syrup so she could sneak off to go and retrieved medicine. Also when the Capitol changed the rules again to only one person can win, Katniss outsmarted by trying to eat berries so would kill both her and Peeta. “so I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena when I poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting the Game makers”(358). 
		In conclusion, Katniss was not only stubborn and determined, but also how she cared for her loved ones and was willing to do anything for them. Also her survival skills were excellent throughout the games, and this is why Katniss should be awarded best tribute of the Hunger Games.</p>
